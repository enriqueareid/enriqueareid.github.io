I'm a 14-year-old student who is interested in Machine Learning, particularly computer vision and NLP. Currently, I am looking for opportunities to develop my machine learning skills in a practical setting.

At the moment, I am taking the [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) course by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and working on my COVID-19 CXR Classification project.
